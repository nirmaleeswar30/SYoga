                Inside every human being there is a network of nerves and sensory organs that interprets the outside physical world. At the same time, within us resides a subtle system of channels (nadis) and centers of energy (chakras) which look after our physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual being. Each of the seven chakras has several spiritual qualities. These qualities are intact within us, and even though they might not always be manifest, they can never be destroyed. When the Kundalini is awakened, these qualities start manifesting spontaneously and express themselves in our life. Thus, through regular meditation, we become automatically very dynamic, creative, confident and at the same time very humble, loving and compassionate. It is a process which starts to develop by itself when the Kundalini rises and starts to nourish our chakras.

            <p class="mb-4">
                The human subtle system rides on the Three Channels – the Left, The Right, & The Central. The left channel (blue), or the Left Sympathetic Nervous System, corresponds to our past, emotions, desires. Its termination is the superego, which is the storehouse of all our memories, habits and conditionings. The right channel (yellow), or the Right Sympathetic Nervous System, corresponds to our actions and planning, to our physical and mental activity. Its termination is the ego, which gives us the idea of "I"-ness, the sense that we are separate from the world. The central channel, or the Para-Sympathetic Nervous System, is the channel of ascent, it is the power which sustains our evolution and guides us, consciously or unconsciously, towards the higher awareness of the Sahastrara (seventh chakra).

            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">The Seven Chakras or The Plexuses</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The human subtle system is governed with the help of Seven Chakras or the Plexuses. Defined as Chakras in the ancient texts, these are now recognised as the nodal points, or Plexuses on the nervous system by the medical science. The plexuses govern the physical functions of the connected organs within the body. On the spiritual side of these plexuses, as Chakras, they also govern and enhance one or more behavioral and emotional qualities in the human being. These seven chakras which are as follows:
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">1. Mooladhara Chakra: Innocence or Purity</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The first chakra is situated below the sacrum bone (This place of Sacrum Bone is Called Mooladhara - in which resides the Kundalini, and it is different from Mooladhara Chakra). The main aspect of Mooladhara Chakra is the innocence. Innocence is the quality by which we experience pure, child-like joy, without the limitations of prejudice or conditionings. Innocence gives us dignity, balance, and a tremendous sense of direction and purpose in life. It is nothing but simplicity, purity and joy. It is the inner wisdom that is ever present in the little children, and gets sometimes clouded by our modern lifestyles. But it is a quality which exists eternally within us and cannot be destroyed, waiting to be manifest as pure joy when the Kundalini rises.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">2. Swadishthan Chakra : Creativity & Pure Attention</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The second chakra is the chakra of creativity, pure attention and pure knowledge. It is the one which connects us to the inner source of inspiration, and enables us to experience the beauty around us. The pure knowledge given by this chakra is not mental, but it is direct perception of the Reality, that can be felt in our palms and indicates our subtle blockages. Also this is the centre of pure, steady attention and power of concentration. On the physical level it looks after our liver, kidneys, and the lower abdomen. When we think too much, this center gets drained of energy and diseases like diabetes or blood cancer can occur when this chakra goes completely out of balance.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">3. Nabhi Chakra : Satisfaction and Generosity</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The third chakra is the one that gives us the sense of generosity, complete satisfaction and contentment. On the left side, the main quality of this center is peace - clearing this chakra can relieve stress and tensions. On the right side, it looks after our liver which is the organ of our attention and power of concentration. When enlightened by the Kundalini, the Nabhi chakra gives us our spiritual ascent, righteousness and inner sense of morality, and complete balance at all levels in our life.</p>

            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">4. The Heart Chakra or Anahat Chakra : The Seat of Spirit</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The fourth chakra, the chakra of the heart, is the place where resides our Spirit, our true Self, which is eternally pure and unaffected by anything, like a shining diamond hidden within us which witnesses all our actions. After Self Realization, our attention becomes for the first time connected to our Spirit and we gradually become aware of it. Our misidentifications with our ego or conditionings drop and we start becoming identified with our Spirit, which is our true nature. On the physical level, this chakra looks after our heart and lungs - if affected, it can cause asthma or various heart conditions. It is from our heart that the compassion and love manifests, and also the heart chakra is the one that gives us the sense of responsibility and pure behavior towards others. The heart chakra manifests in the center (at the level of the sternum bone) as complete security and confidence. All our worries, doubts and fears are destroyed when the heart chakra is fully enlightened by the Kundalini.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">5. Vishuddhi Chakra : Diplomacy and Playful Detachment</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The fifth chakra is the chakra of diplomacy, of pure relationships with others, and of playful detachment. It removes all our guilts and remorses when it is opened by the Kundalini, and gives us a kind and compassionate voice. The tendencies to dominate others or to feel dominated by others, the feelings of superiority or inferiority and all jealousies are removed when this chakra is nourished by the Kundalini. Also, the Vishuddhi is the chakra which gives us the connection with the whole, enabling us to feel our oneness and the fact that we are all part and parcel of the whole.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">6. The Agnya Chakra : Forgiveness And Compassion</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The sixth chakra is the chakra of forgiveness and compassion. Forgiveness is the power to let go of anger, hatred and resentment and to discover, in humility, the nobility and generosity of the Spirit. It is the one that dissolves all our ego, conditionings, habits, false ideas of racialism, and all our misidentifications. It is the narrow gate which opens the way for our consciousness to ascend to its final destination, which is the seventh center. Roving eyes, watching impure things, or self-centeredness damage this chakra. Watching the sky, earth or nature can help cleanse it.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-lg">7. The Sahastrara Chakra : Integration</h1>
            <p class="mb-4">The seventh center integrates all the chakras with their respective qualities. It is the last milestone of the evolution of human awareness. Nowadays, we are at a level which corresponds to this chakra, and our consciousness is able to easily enter into this new realm of perception, which is beyond our limited mind and concepts, and which becomes absolute at the level of the Sahastrara. This chakra gives us the direct, absolute perception of Reality on our central nervous system. This is precisely what is achieved by Self Realization, through the spontaneous awakening of the Kundalini given by Sahaja Yoga. The working of Self Realization and subtle aspects of the chakras and channels are too extensive to be explained here. They are part of a knowledge which is not only to be studied at the mental level, but to be experienced directly. This new level of consciousness can be achieved after Self Realization, through the regular practice of Sahaja Yoga meditation techniques that are taught, always free of charge, in over 75 countries around the world. Kindly refer to the Sahaja Yoga Centers list available on this website to find the closest center to you.</p>
